# DRDO-Intern

This repository contains code and data related to a project on random number generators (RNGs). It includes implementations of both pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) and quantum random number generators (QRNGs), as well as tests for evaluating their randomness.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains data files used for testing the RNGs.
  - `data/prng/`: Contains data files generated by PRNGs.
  - `data/qrng/`: Contains data files generated by QRNGs.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploring and analyzing the RNGs.
  - `notebooks/1.ipynb`: A notebook for initial exploration.
  - `notebooks/2.ipynb`: A notebook for further analysis.
  - `notebooks/qiskit_1.ipynb`: A notebook demonstrating the use of Qiskit for quantum random number generation.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the RNGs and related tests.
  - `src/prng/`: Contains the implementation of the PRNG.
    - `src/prng/prng.py`: The Python code for the PRNG.
  - `src/tests/`: Contains various test suites for evaluating the RNGs.
    - `src/tests/AIS-31/`: Contains tests based on the AIS-31 standard.
    - `src/tests/NIST/`: Contains tests based on the NIST standard.
    - `src/tests/Ultimate/`: Contains a comprehensive suite of randomness tests.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed, along with the following packages:

- numpy
- scipy
- qiskit (if you want to run the quantum random number generation notebook)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy qiskit
```

To run the PRNG, you can execute the `prng.py` script:

```bash
python src/prng/prng.py
```

To run the tests, you can execute the test scripts in the `src/tests/` directory. For example, to run the monobit test from the NIST suite:

```bash
python src/tests/Ultimate/NIST/monobit.py
```
